It is really easy to start writing some little project with TypeScript with the purpose of learning and investigation the language. Ofcourse one could allways use [TypeScript Playground](http://www.typescriptlang.org/play/), but your code is in the browser and you are limited with how much code you can effectively write. For example, it will be inconvenient to use playground during accomplishing assignments fro [TypeScript course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-typescript-microsoft-dev201x-1). 

Obvious solution is using Visual Studio. But it is too heavy and it will constantly distruct you from accomplishing your tasks with huge amounts of options. And in case you are not on Windows machine or you don't have Visual Studio installed you dont even have a lot of options except using some kind of text editor. And I would suggest using Visual Studio Code for this because:

* it is free and open source
* it runs on every platform and obviously on yours as well
* it is lightweight and innovative (for example it does not exploit tabs)
* it has cool design (subbjective)
* it has direct integration with Git
* it has TypeScript support i.e. it shows derived types of code expressions and performs code comletions
* it has folder based projects, which means you dont have to create and support project file like in Visual Studio
